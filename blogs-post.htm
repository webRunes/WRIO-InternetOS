                                Victor came home in an excellent mood – he scored another rarity for his collection
                                    of the past. Gently taking a small slim and transparent plastic box with a logo
                                    of a long gone company out of the package he curiously turned it over in his hands.
                                    Full of excitement he opened it and took it to a brightly let window area to have
                                    a better look at its contents. The disc had “CD-R 650 MB” written on it. He released
                                    the disc from the case with a slight click. Victor turned it and saw barely visible
                                    multi-color sun reflections across the room created by the mirror backside of the
                                    disc.

                                    the disc closer to his eyes.

                                    anybody’s identify. It was generally called “network”. Victor did read that not
                                    so long ago the network was divided into separate fragments called “web sites” and
                                    one needed to know their addresses to access them. They could be found through special
                                    services called search engines, a rather popular feature at that time. He even knew
                                    the name of one of it but it was odd and always skipped his memory. At some time
                                    later new projects appeared.

                                    of the things – now information was looking for the user not the other way around.
                                    Victor was young and has just started to work in web development, he did however
                                    has heard from his more experienced workmates that earlier instead of developing
                                    logic and functionality of projects and filling them with data, people had to think
                                    about such things like separate design and UI for each (!) site. He always felt
                                    sorry for users who had to understand every time what and where was located and
                                    at the same time they had to be content with what the owner of the resource felt
                                    like adding. Or on another hand the user had to endure unnecessary elements of the
                                    forced UI. At the same time developers had to face an insidious beast whose name
                                    was cross-browser compatibility! Victor did not fully understand what the problem
                                    was, but the expressions of those telling the story gave him an idea about the immensity
                                    of the issue. Then phrases like “so that it would be displayed smoothly on the whole,
                                    $#@!, zoo of devices!“ brought to his imagination terrible monsters that the web-developers
                                    fought against like knights in glittering armor. Victor liked reading about knights.

                                While he did not know what “caching” meant he knew that in those days the connection
                                    was slow and at the same time one had to download a lot of junk needed to correctly
                                    display each separate web-site and besides much of that mess was duplicated many
                                    times! However, he tried to be not naive and did not believe every single word he
                                    was told: it often seemed to him that seniors simply pulled his leg and laughed
                                    behind his back. He listened to the stories about attacks referred to with dreadful
                                    words DDoS, or XSS, SQL with a lot of interest. For some reason he imagined virtual
                                    ancient pirate like battles. It was probably because the word “pirates” was also
                                    mentioned from time to time. But later he still had to ask more detailed questions
                                    about the subject. And even if this was true many such attacks couldn’t happen today
                                    as the system simply receives data textually (pure data) and sends is in a such
                                    manner as well. So by default this data cannot harm neither client nor server. Furthermore,
                                    this approach enables instant sending of small kilobyte pages since the client or
                                    server receives only useful data without any HTML, JS and CSS junk.

                                He also knew that earlier web pages were detached from the global processing. This
                                    task was to a very limited extent solved by the search engines he thought of earlier.
                                    He imagined them as the giants with clay feet. Victor liked looking for colorful
                                    analogies. Millions bowed down to them every day to get an answer regarding the
                                    network location of the required information and pity on you if you don’t know how
                                    to ask correctly! Also he heard some blood curdling stories about spam and non-relevant
                                    ads all over the place. The rumor has it that it was practically on every site.
                                    Victor found it rather useful that now the network offered custom ads at the appropriate
                                    moment based on his preferences and requirements but he couldn’t understand what
                                    good it was to show the same canned ads to everyone. Authors of articles, books,
                                    music, and video, manufacturers of various products – all of them had to participate
                                    in the insane rush for consumers. And then these consumers also had to look for
                                    the necessary information and products. An incredible amount of money was spent
                                    for ads and that increased the prices not to mention that these ads were almost
                                    never objective and simply deceived consumers or at best emiftished the goods.

                                The story was that at that time the pieces of network called websites were not able
                                    to distinguish users and knew nothing about their interests. Once again Victor felt
                                    sorry for the users. He pictured them as unfortunate small creatures wandering in
                                    a huge labyrinth, trying to force their way to the required information through
                                    the wilderness of ads and spam that grew in abundance as enormous trees and tried
                                    to catch users with their nasty branches. And even if someone managed to avoid them,
                                    it was too early to rejoice: one had to mind further steps as not to be trapped
                                    by fraudulent websites that were spread all over the network. The Trust Level concept
                                    was not used at that time as a universal tool that got rid of fakes and spam once
                                    and for all.

                                However social networks were the craftiest! Many users didn’t even suspect or simply
                                    didn’t listen to people warning about the risk of providing personal data to such
                                    resources. Victor just shook his head in amazement and disbelief when he heard stories
                                    about such networks. Now every user had an individual reliable Vault-server that
                                    securely safeguarded the owner’s data. The theft of personal data is severely punished
                                    but to think that someone was to give it to others on their own?? No, apparently
                                    these were just tall tales or at least greatly exaggerated stories like many other
                                    things told him by his senior colleagues about the Internet past. The only thing
                                    that he didn’t doubt was that all user data was saved not on Vault-servers but locally
                                    or on discs like the one he held in this hands – a piece of the past sparkling in
                                    the sun rays!
