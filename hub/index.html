        "“I have a dream for the Web in which computers become capable of analyzing all the data on the Web – the content, links, and transactions between people and computers.” A “Semantic Web”, which makes this possible, has yet to emerge, but when it does, the day-to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines. The “intelligent agents” people have touted for ages will finally materialize.” — Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web.",
        "Information is everything. The number of Internet users is nearing 4 billion, while generated information doubles every 18 months. There are 23 bln connected devices in the world and their number doubles every 36 months. Global Internet traffic in 2020 will be equivalent to 100 times the volume of the entire global Internet in 2005. We are rushing into the era of Internet of Things and Big Data where an automated processing of data will be a must. It will require a platform that will unite the web of machines and users. The key for this unification will be a machine-readable data format. Automatic processing of data will pave the way for a user-centric Web 3.0, where users receive screened information automatically based on their interests.",
        "Web 3.0 = Semantics + Blockchain + Smart Contracts",
        "The Semantic Web is a web of data that can be processed directly and indirectly by machines.",
        "A Blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way.",
        "Smart Contracts is a self-executing algorithms of interaction with the blockchain.",
        "WRIO Internet OS is a blockchain-powered machine-readable Web 3.0 platform focused  on automatic data processing and a user-centric secure browsing experience. The name originates from the acronym of “webRunes Input/Output Internet Operating System”. Browser-driven approach allows the system to work with any device that has a browser and Internet connection, which is reflected in the project motto: “All you need is a browser”.",
        "All user actions and browsing are performed through a personal WRIO Internet OS web dashboard. User-centric web dashboards are the next Big Thing and semantics, automatic data processing and blockchain powered apps are new trends that will replace many of the visionary technology projects of the past. We will see user-centric version of googles, skypes, ebays, paypals, facebooks, ubers and more.",
        "Evolution of user-centric web will result in the era of smart predictive systems – Individual Assistants (IA) that will replace today’s primitive virtual assistants. IA is a global network of intelligent agents that continuously exchange data with each other. Their use will be universal and will cover all areas of life: connected homes management systems in view of the weather and according to the schedule, needs and preferences of each family member; automatic secretaries and data processing assistants; business, healthcare and education consultants; and etc.",
