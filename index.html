        "articleBody": [
        "/* Disclaimer: This White Paper is intended for general readers. You do not need to be sound on how the Internet works to understand underlying concepts. However, those readers that wish to go deeply into the technicals can find more details in “WRIO OS Architecture” section of this book. */",
        "/* The project is in the initial stage of development. The functions described below will be added as it progresses. */",
        "WRIO Internet OS, or simply WRIO OS, is your window to the world of decentralized, semantic and secure Internet based on the blockchain technology, with the function of Intelligent Assistant. The name originates from the acronym of “webRunes Input/Output Internet Operating System”, and it intends to replace desktop OS’s in the future.",
        "At the dawn of the computer era, due to the stand-alone nature of computers there was a need in desktop operating systems. Now, at the Internet age, we have an opportunity to use network resources, which contributed to the rise of numerous cloud services such as Dropbox or Netflix. Web-technologies provide an opportunity to get rid of the necessity to install desktop applications, yet WRIO OS goes even further: by developing and uniting cloud services we arrive at the situation when we do not need the desktop OS at all. Access to the Internet allows to replace it with just a browser thus excluding the need in powerful processors and large memory size, and broadband access does the same for high capacity HDDs.",
        "There were many attempts to develop a web based OS. However, those were a copy of desktop OS, which resulted in the development of a system designed to perform cloud tasks through the desktop approach, and, consequently, such attempts failed.",
        "In order to understand why it happened, we will consider two cases: operation of a desktop OS and WRIO OS. Each modern device (computer, smartphone, tablet and etc.) has an operating system, such as Windows or Linux. All these OSs differ greatly but have the same weak points: they become morally obsolete, need to be updated, have their own sets of drivers, low or no compatibility with each other; certain technical knowledge is required to be able to install, setup or repair them; they are vulnerable to viruses, key loggers and other malware, and etc. The only their advantage is that they do not require Internet for operation, that is they are stand-alone. Yet, it is no secret that every day more and more people solve their professional and personal tasks just using a browser. Going on with using a desktop OS we add a set of Internet threats to the problems mentioned above: malware scripts, fraud and phishing, the risk of losing access to numerous accounts of various services due to the absence of transferability – we have to register in each and every new service over and over again. The problem was to a certain extent solved by logins through social media, but this leads to a greater risk – our private data no longer belong to us: social media sell them to third parties and transfer to government entities. Fortunately, day by day more and more people become concerned and begin to understand that the loss of control over personal data will lead to the loss of freedom.",
        "WRIO Internet OS deals with the mentioned problems, and in subsequent chapters we will consistently describe the solution of each of them. For now it shall be noted that desktop OSs may and shall be replaced with web-OSs resulting in the creation of simple, and hence more reliable, cost-cutting and affordable devices with a minimalistic and lightweight operational system being merely a browser. Such systems will weigh just dozens of megabytes, i.e. hundreds or thousands of times less than today’s desktop monsters. Instant boot, minimal or no need in updates aside from pure browser updates, reliability and maximum protection due to the ability to load in a virtual container will be key features of such systems.",
        "WRIO OS is an easy to use shell organized as a set of web-applications functioning as desktop programs. The user’s ability to pick up a completely customized set of web-applications will result in the change of the Internet paradigm and birth of a user-centered web. A system of such kind will always stay up-to-date and will not require any technical expertise to install or setup, while access to the personal cloud from any device using a multi-factor authentication will solve the problem of personal data loss or theft.",
        "User data protection is one of the key priorities of WRIO OS: the universal use of cryptography and encryption along with the provision of anonymity will ensure maximum security. And the symbiosis with various anonymous networks will enable the use of advanced technologies without the need to understand them.",
        "WRIO OS is an isomorphic JavaScript application. These are advanced systems that work equally well both on a client and a server. Such adaptive applications can actualize various levels of client-server processing depending on the channel width and client capacities. In our case we go beyond the approach described in the link above. There is no need to divide transferred data into data for users and search bots.",
        "WRIO OS is not just a cloud OS. It creates a peer-to-peer distributed system and utilizes computing power of all consolidated computers, providing user only with the results of data processing and computations.",
        "It shall be noted that despite of the fact that the system requires an access to the Internet to ensure its fully-featured operation, WRIO OS can be also used offline to a limited extent: reading of earlier downloaded news, viewing of video clips, listening to music, management of documents with subsequent synchronization online, and some other functions. With each passing day Internet infrastructure’s cost goes down while its quality goes up, thus the problem with access to the Internet is diminished.",
        "Not only WRIO OS paves a way into the future where any device will have just a browser installed, but also, which is more important, it will change the Internet and will bring it to a brand new level that some call web 3.0 or semantic web. Instead of today's obsolete sites we work with pure semantic data and personalized recommendation system, and blockchain performs the function of a generally available and uncensored global catalogue. Web 3.0 will lead to the Internet-of-Things.",
        "The WRIO OS’s support of third-party sites 2.0 will help to ensure a phased transition to the new level, and the semantic web revolution will pass unnoticed by the majority of users as a smooth evolution."

        "Nowadays Internet is marked by a number of drawbacks. The most significant of them is its centralized nature, which makes the Internet exposed to restrictions and censorship on the part of corporations and governments. The mixing of data and representation results in technical flaws. Apart from the data you may need, every web-page contains an “envelope” – the rules that a browser uses to interpret how the page shall be displayed. As the Internet developed, such envelopes became so heavy that useful data sometimes accounts for only 5-10% of a page size. At first glance this may seem unimportant, though the page size not only influences the cost of Internet-services (which may be essential in case of mobile Internet), but also has a direct effect on the download speed, and therefore your latency time. The mixing of data and representation makes computer parsing significantly more complex and hinders the sorting and cataloging of information by search engines, which undermines the accuracy and relevancy of their responses to your search queries. Unfortunately, Internet pages look like a mish-mash, from which it is difficult for search engines to withdraw data. The result is that the Internet lacks what it was originally planned for by the web inventor Tim Berners-Lee – semantics.",
        "WRIO OS is meant to rectify the above mentioned flaws and is committed to achieve the following goals:",
        "* the Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries. The term was coined by Tim Berners-Lee for a web of data that can be processed by machines (Wikipedia). Such a Web will allow users to find the appropriate information with ease and accuracy unavailable nowadays. Semantics leads to another important feature – openness",
        "* the openness enables an unrestricted reading of data stored on third-party servers. It means the use of data from the original sources without a need in multiple duplication and loss of consistency. Today data are secured. That is if you want to use them on your own page, you either need to copy them, or obtain them through API, which is often means technical or financial restrictions. Besides, there might be problems with the hated-by-all-free-Internet copyright, which will be discussed separately in the Open Copyright section",
        "* decentralization. In its turn the web openness allows to create a decentralized Internet, which will not only provide a free access to information, but will also terminate corporations’ and social media’s control over public user data. If you consider that being a phony issue and cling to the notion that you are of no importance, then read “Alternative: I Have Nothing to Hide” section of the book",
        "* the decentralization also means the immunity to persistent control and censorship attempts on the part of the government, as well as mass surveillance",
        "* security. Every time you visit an unfamiliar website you take the risk of running into spam, viruses, malware, and other Internet threats. This is all because the code embedded into web-pages, apart from adding interactivity and functionality, may pose a threat, download and run abusers’ programs. Security issues and how WRIO OS can help to deal with them will be discussed in a separate chapter",
        "These are not all the drawbacks of the nowadays Internet that we described. More of them are consistently discussed in the following chapters. For now it is just worthwhile to note that solving any of the problems opens new opportunities for us as users. And every chapter read will provide new details on how young the Internet still is, that we are yet at the beginning of its development, and the  potential of this great invention is far from being fully unleashed. The book describes a number of different wondrous technologies that will help to bring the web to a whole new level; it will show what can become of it, what is required, what effect it will have, and how it will eventually change each of us, the society and the world in general."
